### Quickstartüë®‚Äçüíª

Browse a [complete list of featured you can contribute to][Ducumentation.md] and locate a particular badge by using the search bar or by browsing the categories. Click on the badge to fill in required data elements for that badge type (like your username or repo) and optionally customize (label, colors etc.). And it's ready for use!

Use the button at the bottom to copy your badge url or snippet, which can then be added to places like your GitHub readme files or other web pages.

## Contributing

Otofast Project Community. We invite your participation through issues
and pull requests. You can peruse the [contributing guidelines][contributing].

When adding or changing a service [please add tests][service-tests].

This project has quite a backlog of suggestions! If you're new to the project,
maybe you'd like to open a pull request to address one of them.

You can read a [tutorial on how to add a badge][tutorial].

## Development

1. Install Node 16 or later. You can use the [package manager][] of your choice.
   Tests need to pass in Node 16 and 17.
2. Clone this repository.
3. Run `npm i or yarn add` to install the dependencies.
4. Run `npm run dev or yarn run dev` to start the badge server and the frontend dev server.
5. Open `http://localhost:3000/` to view the frontend.

When server source files change, the badge server should automatically restart
itself (using [nodemon][]). When the frontend files change, the frontend dev
server (`gatsby dev`) should also automatically reload. However the badge
definitions are built only before the server first starts. To regenerate those,
either run `npm run defs` or manually restart the server.

To debug a badge from the command line, run `npm run badge -- /npm/v/nock`.
It also works with full URLs like
`npm run badge -- https://img.shields.io/npm/v/nock`.

Use `npm run debug:server` to start server in debug mode.
[This recipe][nodemon debug] shows how to debug Node.js application in [VS Code][].


Daily tests, including a full run of the service tests and overall code coverage, are run via [badges/daily-tests][daily-tests].
